##  Type I: Rejecting H0, when H0 is actually true! 


Type II: Failing to reject H 0 , when H 0 is actually false!

There are two types of errors that can be made? and we assign probabilities.
+ Revision: Type I and II errors

**Decision**

(Power = 1 ? )

.blue[Power]

.red[Power]

.orange[Power]

.purple[Power]

.green[Power]

.yellow[Power]


Type I error is when we: *Incorrectly Reject H* *0*

Type II error is when we: *Incorrectly NOT Reject H* *0*

OR

OR

Power is about your ability to:

Correctly Reject H 0

```{r tbl2, echo = FALSE}
tbl2 <- tibble::tribble(
~` `, ~`True`, ~`Situation`,
" ","H 0 True","H 0 False",
"H 0 Rejected","Type I Error","Correct Decision",
" "," "," ",
"H 0 Not Rejected","Correct Decision","Type II error",
" "," "," "
)

kableExtra::kable_styling(knitr::kable(tbl2), font_size = 18)
```

High Power is Desirable . But it depends on four aspects:
+ Revision: Power of a Hypothesis test

```{r tbl3, echo = FALSE}
tbl3 <- tibble::tribble(
~`Size of ?difference? to detect`, ~`?distance? between value of parameter under null hypothesis and the true value of the parameter. greater distance           greater the power.`,
"Population Standard Deviation/s","- smaller population standard deviation leads to greater power of the test.",
"Sample size/s","- larger sample sizes leads to greater power of the test.",
"Significance level","- a larger level of significance leads to greater power of the test ( BUT ALSO THE GREATER THE CHANCE OF A TYPE I ERROR )."
)

kableExtra::kable_styling(knitr::kable(tbl3), font_size = 18)
```

#   Advantages of Questionnaires 

+ Helps researcher obtain data relatively easily (time, cost, effort).
+ Information easily coded (analyses determined *a priori* ).
+ Benefits scientific community if measures are valid and reliable
	+ Ambiguity and poor measurement practices thwart this.
+ **When to Use a Questionnaire**
+ When large numbers of people are to be reached in different geographical regions.
+ When groups of people can be assembled in a convenient location to whom questionnaires can be administered, and collected immediately.
+ A questionnaire i s a pre-formulated written set of questions to which respondents record their answers
+ Questionnaire

#  Principles of wordingPrinciples of measurementGeneral appearanceQuestionnaire administration and testing 

+ *"... poorly designed and executed ... surveys are a form of censorship of the respondents' views"*
+ (Draper and Hill, 1996).
+ Statistical analyses cannot be better than the quality of the data. Important to have valid and reliable measurement procedures . . . .   . . . else the study only suitable for an autopsy.

Poor quality data from poor designs and collection techniques will lead to poor experimental outcomes and useless conclusions for the objectives of the study.

#  Statistics is about making inference about a population without needing to collect data from all elements of the population  


Population

**<U+F06D>, <U+F073>, <U+F073>** **2** **, <U+F070>  (parameters)**

**Estimate**

#  Simple Random Sampling 

+ Ensures every element in the sampling frame has an **equal chance** of being selected.
+ Is the most **representative** of the population for most purposes.
+ Probability Sampling
+ **Systematic Sampling**
+ E very n th element in the population starting with a randomly chosen element.
+ Don?t need to specify total sampling frame or number all items.
+ Example :
	+ (Consumer behaviour) Supermarket studying purchasing preferences of customers, they can choose every 5 th customer entering the supermarket and conduct the survey.

#  Stratified Random Sampling 

#  Probability Sampling 

+ Sampling from **mutually exclusive sub-populations** , or strata, from the population
	+ attitudes towards Blackboard: students divided into 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd years.
	+ employee morale: employees stratified into clerks, supervisors, managers, etc.
	+ clinical trials: patients stratified by gender.
+ ***Homogeneity*** ** within each strata ** and **heterogeneity** 

between strata.
+ Eg. Managers act similarly to other managers, but different to tradesman.
+ **Simple random sampling** used on each strata.
+ Cluster Sampling
+ Dividing the population into non-overlapping areas or clusters where there is *heterogeneity within clusters.*
	+ E.g., test effects of information programme on school children: test in certain schools.
+ Entire cluster used. Clusters selected using **simple random sampling** .

#  Randomisation:	- randomly assigning subjects to treatment groups.		- randomly assigning the order.  


*Replication* :	- repeating the experiment over **many subjects** .

- provides better estimates; reduces SE of estimate (mean).

(Not  ?Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic , but ? )
+ *Replication*
+ *Blocking* ******
+ *Randomisation*

***Source: Howley (JSE, 2003)***
+ Experimental Design: The Three R?s

*Blocking* : 	- If a factor is of ***no interest*** to the prediction of the outcome 			variable, *but is* ***known to influence*** **** the values of the outcome 		variable, *Y* , then it is better to randomise within blocks ( eg , gender 		on drug effectiveness).

**Why?** It controls for a source of variation in *Y* , thus SE of the 			estimated means will be reduced.
