## Teaching Philosophy and Relevance

- Applied course: application remains the focus.  
    - However, to help you be able to apply and interpret methods correctly, valuable to understand the:  
    - Rationale of the techniques
    
- Underlying principles
    - May include some theory, mathematics and ‘broad’ descriptions
    - We will endeavour to
        - keep the links clear
        - develop solid conceptual understanding
        - explore the broad algebraic issues rather than delve deeply into the mathematics of the techniques  


## Key Topics This Week

* $\Box$ Revision  
    - $\Box$ Parameters v Statistics  
    - $\Box$ Sampling Distributions  
    - $\Box$ Single and Two Populations  

* $\Box$ Critical Value Method  

* $\Box$ Type I and II Errors  

* $\Box$ Statistical Power for a test  


## Review of Hypothesis Testing

1. State the Null (H$_0$) and Alternative (H$_A$) Hypotheses
    - in terms of parameter(s) being considered
2. Calculate the test statistic
3. Calculate the p-value
4. Decision: reject or not reject
5. Conclusion
    - in terms of the original, practical, problem being addressed


## Hypothesis Testing – The Concept

$\color{red}{INCREASE \  GAP}$

> - We have a belief or something we wish to test 
>     - a difference exists between males' and females' mean reaction times  
>     - known children's personality in TV ads increases kids' recall of the product, compared with unknown announcer
> - We state our beliefs in two hypotheses
>     - Null involves 'no difference' or 'equality in groups'
>     - Aternative involves what we are normally interested in testing
> - We collect some data
>     - We compare the data that we collected with what we would expect to see if null
hypothesis were true using the test statistic 
> - Decide whether results are sufficiently different by calculating the p-value - the probability of observinig our test statistic conditional on the null hypothesis being true 
> - Reject or not reject the null hypothesis based on the p-value and the significance level ($\alpha$)
